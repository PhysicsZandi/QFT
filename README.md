# QFT

In this repository, we will provide computations in QFT (QED, QCD, Standard Model) using Feyncalc of Wolfram Mathematica.

In [pdf](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/IsingModel/blob/main/pdf), you will find Mathematica notebooks with results of scattering amplitudes (normal, squared and massless).
